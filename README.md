## Where to start

Check out the [Demo](https://github.com/curiousbadger/pyWitnessSolver/wiki/Demo) in the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/curiousbadger/pyWitnessSolver/wiki/) to get a sense of what this does.


All the [puzzle definitions]( tests/puzzle_definitions.py ) are written out as functions which you can call [from the puzzle test driver script](tests/puzzle_test_driver.py).
